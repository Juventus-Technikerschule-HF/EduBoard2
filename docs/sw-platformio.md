# PlatformIO

PlatformIO is a Addon for Visual Studio Code. Streamlineing the Programming and Debugging process for many different Microcontrollers make it a powerful tool for Software Development. 

Its capability to provide hasslefree framework integration and programming/debugging on multiple different platforms. Theefore it was chosen to be the base for the Development Environment for Eduboard2.

Of course the integrated Project Creator could be used, but the readymade Project Templates on Github provide a full BSP (Board Support package) to access the Hardware on the Eduboard2.
