# Eduboard2 Hardware

The Eduboard2 was designed with 3 maingoals in mind:
- Support different Microcontroller-Platforms
    - The Microcontroller is separated out onto a second Board, connected via m.2. This allows easy adaptability to other microcontrollers. The first supported Microcontroller was descided to be the ESP32-S3. The ESP32-S3 can be programmed and debugged via USB.
- Have a wide and modern variety of Peripheral options
    - From the classics like buttons leds and potentiometers up to a modern Color screen with capacitive touch. Also some external Interfaces like RS485 are present. 
- be cheaper in production then the first iteration
    - Production of the Eduboard2 is done at JLCPCB. This cuts the costs even with the two seperate boards more then in half.
